This project demonstrates how to automatically deploy a static website using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.
I have created simple HTML and css file for the simple website, and yml file was written which copy all the contents from main branch and save to public folder which is deployed on github pages whose link is shown above.
The websit automatically updates with each commit/push.
